- 👋 Hi, I’m @efudurich aka "Ed" I am retired after 50+years as an EE. (Old) background areas as a hardware and software nerd are in telecommunications, audio, video, GPS/GNSS and now into Arduino and Raspberry Pi, and occasionaly helping my son debug/restore 60s-80s audio electronics (vacuum tubes light me up).
- 👀 I’m interested in all the above fields before old-age kicks in.
- 🌱 I’m currently working with Arduinos - which I have adapted as fault monitors for my pool, irrigation, and landscape lighting controllers. (Although their respective controllers do their job for the time being, they don't really monitor their systems for faults or provide FTP activity/event logs, etc.) 
- 💞️ Although I do occasionally help the u-blox.com customer portal as @grampy, at present I’m not looking to collaborate on any projects due to family priorities.
- 📫 How to reach me --- apologies in advance but my accessibility is throttled way down due to aforementioned family priorities.
